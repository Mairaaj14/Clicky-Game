# üêâ Dragon Ball Z Memory Game üêâ

## Overview
Memory game created with React.

## Overview
Using React and Node.js we will create a memory clicky game. Inspired by Dragon Ball Z, I decided to create my memory game based on my favorite characters! As the game starts, user is told to click on any image, as the user clicks on a character the cards randomly shuffle. User is not allowed to click on the same character card more than ONCE! If user clicks on the same character twice it's a loss and score will go back to 0! Game records users top score and restarts current score once they lose!

### Getting Started
You can find my deployed game [here](https://mairaaj14.github.io/Clicky-Game/)

You will need to create a react-app and do a `yarn install` to begin building your game.
Node is required as a pre-requesite in order for your game to work.

Here is a code snippet of how my file structure looks:

``` 
public	
- favicon.ico	
  index.html	
  manifest.json
src	
- components	
    -CharacterCard.js
     Header.js

  App.test.js	
  characters.json

  index.js	
  logo.svg	
  serviceWorker.js
.gitignore	
package.json	
yarn.lock
```
